<span id="sec06"></span>6. A Principal or Main Question or Motion, is a
motion made to bring before the assembly, for its consideration, any
particular subject. No Principal Motion can be made when any other
question is before the assembly. It takes precedence of nothing, and
yields to all Privileged, Incidental and Subsidiary Questions \[§§ 7, 8,
9\].

<span id="sec07"></span>7. Subsidiary or Secondary Questions or Motions
relate to a Principal Motion, and enable the assembly to dispose of it
in the most appropriate manner. These motions take precedence of the
Principal Question, and must be decided before the Principal Question
can be acted upon. They yield to Privileged and Incidental Questions
\[§§ 8, 9\], and are as follows (being arranged in their order of
precedence among themselves):

Lie on the Table ……………….. See § 19.  
The Previous Question …………… ” § 20.  
Postpone to a Certain Day ……….. ” § 21.  
Commit ………………………… ” § 22.  
Amend …………………………. ” § 23.  
Postpone Indefinitely …………… ” § 24.

Any of these motions (except Amend) can be made when one of a lower
order is pending, but none can supersede one of a higher order. They
cannot be applied\* \[See Plan of Work and Definitions, in Introduction,
for explanation of some of these technical terms.\] to one another
except in the following cases: (a) the Previous Question applies to the
motion to Postpone, without affecting the principal motion, and can, if
specified, be applied to a pending amendment \[§ 20\]; (b) the motions
to Postpone to a certain day, and to Commit, can be amended; and (c) a
motion to Amend the minutes can be laid on the table without carrying
the minutes with it \[§ 19\].

<span id="sec08"></span>8. Incidental Questions are such as arise out of
other questions, and, consequently, take precedence of, and are to be
decided before, the questions which give rise to them. They yield to
Privileged Questions \[§ 9\], and cannot be amended. Excepting an
Appeal, they are undebatable; an Appeal is debatable or not, according
to circumstances, as shown in § 14. They are as follows:

Appeal (or Questions of Order) ……………………… See § 14.  
  Objection to the Consideration of a Question …………. ” § 15.  
  The Reading of Papers ……………………………… ” § 16.  
  Leave to Withdraw a Motion …………………………. ” § 17.  
  Suspension of the Rules ……………………………. ” § 18.

<span id="sec09"></span>9. Privileged Questions are such as, on account
of their importance, take precedence over all other questions whatever,
and on account of this very privilege they are undebatable \[§ 35\],
excepting when relating to the rights of the assembly or its members, as
otherwise they could be made use of so as to seriously interrupt
business. They are as follows (being arranged in their order of
precedence among themselves):

To Fix the Time to which the Assembly shall Adjourn …… See § 10.  
  Adjourn ………………………………………….. ” § 11.  
  Questions relating to the Rights and  
    Privileges of the Assembly or any of  
    its Members …………………………………….. ” § 12.  
  Call for the Orders of the Day ……………………… ” § 13.
