<span id="sec65"></span>65. Rules of Speaking in Debate. All remarks
must be addressed to the chairman, and must be confined to the question
before the assembly, avoiding all personalities and reflections upon any
one’s motives. It is usual for permanent assemblies to adopt rules
limiting the number of times any member can speak to the same question,
and the time allowed for each speech;\* \[In Congress the House of
Representatives allows from each member only one speech of one hour’s
length; the Senate allows two speeches without limit as to length.\] as
otherwise one member, while he could speak only once to the same
question, might defeat a measure by prolonging his speech and declining
to yield the floor except for a motion to adjourn. In ordinary
assemblies two speeches should be allowed each member (except upon an
appeal), and these rules also limit the time for each speech to ten
minutes. A majority can permit a member to speak oftener or longer
whenever it is desired, and the motion granting such permission cannot
be debated.

However, if greater freedom is wanted, it is only necessary to consider
the question informally, or if the assembly is large, go into committee
of the whole.\* \[See Rules of Order, §§ 32, 33.\] If on the other hand
it is desired to limit the debate more, or close it altogether, it can
be done by a two-thirds vote, as shown in § 58 (b).

Main Question to Debate. \[A full list of these will be found in § 35,
to which the reader is referred. To the undebatable motions in that
list, should be added the motion to close or limit debate.\]
