<span id="sec55"></span>55. Motions Classified According to their
Object. Instead of immediately adopting or rejecting a resolution as
originally submitted, it may be desirable to dispose of it in some other
way, and for this purpose various motions have come into use, which can
be made while a resolution is being considered, and for the time being,
supersede it. No one can make any of these motions while another member
has the floor, excepting as shown in § 64, which see for the
circumstances under which each motion can be made.

The following list comprises most of these motions, arranged in eight
classes, according to the object for which each motion is used. \[The
names of the motions are printed in Italics; each class is treated
separately, as shown by the references.\]

<span id="sec56"></span><span id="sec56a"></span>56. To Amend or Modify.
(a) Amend. If it is desired to modify the question in any way, the
proper motion to make is to “amend,” either by “adding” words, or by
“striking out” words; or by “striking out certain words and inserting
others;” or by “substituting” a different motion on the same subject for
the one before the assembly; or by “dividing the question” into two or
more questions, as the mover specifies, so as to get a separate vote on
any particular point or points. Sometimes the enemies of a measure seek
to amend it in such a way as to divide its friends, and thus defeat it.

When the amendment has been moved and seconded, the chairman should
always state the question distinctly, so that every one may know exactly
what is before them, reading first the paragraph which it is proposed to
amend; then the words to be struck out, if there are any; next, the
words to be inserted, if any; and finally, the paragraph as it will
stand if the amendment is adopted. He then states that the question is
on the adoption of the amendment, which is open to debate, the remarks
being confined to the merits of the amendment, only going into the main
question so far as is necessary in order to ascertain the propriety of
adopting the amendment.

This amendment can be amended, but an “amendment of an amendment” cannot
be amended. None of the undebatable motions mentioned in § 66, except to
fix the time to which to adjourn, can be amended, nor can the motion to
postpone indefinitely.

<span id="sec56b"></span>(b) Commit. If the original question is not
well digested, or needs more amendment than can well be made in the
assembly, it is usual to move “to refer it to a committee.” This motion
can be made while an amendment is pending, and it opens the whole merits
of the question to debate. This motion can be amended by specifying the
number of the committee, or how they shall be appointed, or when they
shall report, or by giving them any other instructions. \[See § 53 on
committees, and § 46 (c) on their appointment.\]

<span id="sec57"></span><span id="sec57a"></span>57. To Defer Action.
(a) Postpone to a certain time. If it is desired to defer action upon a
question till a particular time, the proper motion to make, is to
“postpone it to that time.” This motion allows of but limited debate,
which must be confined to the propriety of the postponement to that
time; it can be amended by altering the time, and this amendment allows
of the same debate. The time specified must not be beyond that session
\[§ 70\] of the assembly, except it be the next session, in which case
it comes up with the unfinished business at the next session. This
motion can be made when a motion to amend, or to commit or to postpone
indefinitely, is pending.

<span id="sec57b"></span>(b) Lie on the table. Instead of postponing a
question to a particular time, it may be desired to lay it aside
temporarily until some other question is disposed of, retaining the
privilege of resuming its consideration at any time.\* \[In Congress
this motion is commonly used to defeat a measure, though it does not
prevent a majority from taking it at any other time. Some societies
prohibit a question from being taken from the table, except by a
two-thirds vote. This rule deprives the society of the advantages of the
motion to “lie on the table.” because it would not be safe to lay a
question aside temporarily, if one-third of the assembly were opposed to
the measure, as that one-third could prevent its ever being taken from
the table. A bare majority should not have the power, in ordinary
societies, to adopt or reject a question, or prevent its consideration,
without debate. \[See note at end of § 35, Rules of Order, on the
principles involved in making questions undebatable.\] The only way to
accomplish this, is to move that the question “lie on the table.” This
motion allowing of neither debate nor amendment, the chairman
immediately puts the question; if carried, the whole matter is laid
aside until the assembly vote to “take it from the table” (which latter
motion is undebatable and possesses no privilege). Sometimes this motion
is used to suppress a measure, as shown in § 59 (c).

<span id="sec58"></span><span id="sec58a"></span>58. To Suppress Debate.
(a) Previous Question. While as a general rule free debate is allowed
upon every motion,\* \[Except an “objection to the consideration of the
question” \[§ 59 (a)\]. See note to § 35, Rules of Order, for a full
discussion of this subject of debate.\] which, if adopted, has the
effect of adopting the original question or removing it from before the
assembly for the session,—yet, to prevent a minority from making an
improper use of this privilege, it is necessary to have methods by which
debate can be closed, and final action at once be taken upon a question.

To accomplish this, when any debatable question is before the assembly,
it is only necessary for some one to obtain the floor and “call for the
previous question;” this call being seconded, the chairman, as it allows
of no debate, instantly puts the question, thus: “Shall the main
question be now put?” If this is carried by a two-thirds vote \[§ 68\],
all debate instantly ceases, excepting that the member who offered the
original resolution, or reported it from a committee, is, as in all
other cases, entitled to the floor to close the debate; after which, the
chairman immediately puts the questions to the assembly, first, on the
motion to commit, if it is pending; if this is carried, of course the
subject goes to the committee; if, however, it fails, the vote is next
taken on amendments, and finally on the resolution as amended.

If a motion to postpone, either definitely or indefinitely, or a motion
to reconsider, or an appeal is pending, the previous question is
exhausted by the vote on the postponement, reconsideration or appeal,
and does not cut off debate upon any other motions that may be pending.
If the call for the previous question fails, that is, the debate is not
cut off, the debate continues the same as if this motion had not been
made. The previous question can be called for simply on an amendment,
and after the amendment has been acted upon, the main question is again
open to debate.

<span id="sec58b"></span>(b) An order limiting or closing debate.
Sometimes, instead of cutting off debate entirely by ordering the
previous question, it is desirable to allow of but very limited debate.
In this case, a motion is made to limit the time allowed each speaker or
the number of speeches on each side, or to appoint a time at which
debate shall close and the question be put. The motion may be made to
limit debate on an amendment, in which case the main question would
afterwards be open to debate and amendment; or it may be made simply on
an amendment to an amendment.

In ordinary societies, where harmony is so important, a two-thirds vote
should be required for the adoption of any of the above motions to cut
off or limit debate.\* \[In the House of Representatives, these motions
require only a majority vote for their adoption. In the Senate, to the
contrary, not even two-thirds of the members can force a measure to its
passage without allowing debate, the Senate rules not recognizing the
above motions.

<span id="sec59"></span><span id="sec59a"></span>59. To Suppress the
Question. (a) Objection to the consideration of a question. Sometimes a
resolution is introduced that the assembly do not wish to consider at
all, because it is profitless, or irrelevant to the objects of the
assembly, or for other reasons. The proper course to pursue in such
case, is for some one, as soon as it is introduced, to “object to the
consideration of the question.” This objection not requiring a second,
the chairman immediately puts the question, “Will the assembly consider
this question?” If decided in the negative by a two-thirds vote, the
question is immediately dismissed, and cannot be again introduced during
that session. This objection must be made when the question is first
introduced, before it has been debated, and it can be made when another
member has the floor.

<span id="sec59b"></span>(b) Postpone indefinitely. After the question
has been debated, the proper motion to use in order to suppress the
question for the session, is to postpone indefinitely. It cannot be made
while any motion except the original or main question is pending, but it
can be made after an amendment has been acted upon, and the main
question, as amended, is before the assembly. It opens the merits of the
main question to debate to as great an extent as if the main question
were before the assembly. On account of these two facts, in assemblies
with short sessions it is not very useful, as the same result can
usually be more easily attained by the next motion.

<span id="sec59c"></span>(c) Lie on the table. If there is no
possibility during the remainder of the session of obtaining a majority
vote for taking up the question, then the quickest way of suppressing it
is to move “that the question lie on the table;” which, allowing of no
debate, enables the majority to instantly lay the question on the table,
from which it cannot be taken without their consent.

From its high rank \[§ 64\] and undebatable character, this motion is
very commonly used to suppress a question, but, as shown in § 57 (b),
its effect is merely to lay the question aside till the assembly choose
to consider it, and it only suppresses the question so long as there is
a majority opposed to its consideration.

<span id="sec60"></span><span id="sec60a"></span>60. To Consider a
question a second time. Reconsider. When a question has been once
adopted, rejected or suppressed, it cannot be again considered during
that session \[§ 70\], except by a motion to “reconsider the vote” on
that question. This motion can only be made by one who voted on the
prevailing side, and on the day the vote was taken which it is proposed
to reconsider.\* \[In Congress it can be made on the same or succeeding
day; and if the yeas and nays were not taken on the vote, any one can
move the reconsideration. The yeas and nays are however ordered on all
important votes in Congress, which is not the case in ordinary
societies.\] It can be made and entered on the minutes in the midst of
debate, even when another member has the floor, but cannot be considered
until there is no question before the assembly, when, if called up, it
takes precedence of every motion except to adjourn and to fix the time
to which the assembly shall adjourn.

A motion to reconsider a vote on a debatable question, opens to debate
the entire merits of the original motion. If the question to be
reconsidered is undebatable, then the reconsideration is undebatable.

If the motion to reconsider is carried, the chairman announces that the
question now recurs on the adoption of the question the vote on which
has been just reconsidered: the original question is now in exactly the
same condition that it was in before the first vote was taken on its
adoption, and must be disposed of by a vote.

When a motion to reconsider is entered on the minutes, it need not be
called up by the mover till the next meeting, on a succeeding day.\*
\[If the assembly has not adopted these or similar rules, this paragraph
would not apply, but this motion to reconsider would, like any other
motion, fall to the ground if not acted upon before the close of the
session at which the original vote was adopted.\] If he fails to call it
up then, any one else can do so. But should there be no succeeding
meeting, either adjourned or regular, within a month, then the effect of
the motion to reconsider terminates with the adjournment of the meeting
at which it was made, and any one can call it up at that meeting.

In general no motion (except to adjourn) that has been once acted upon,
can again be considered during the same session, except by a motion to
reconsider. \[The motion to adjourn can be renewed if there has been
progress in business or debate, and it cannot be reconsidered.\] But
this rule does not prevent the renewal of any of the motions mentioned
in § 64, provided the question before the assembly has in any way
changed; for in this case, while the motions are nominally the same,
they are in fact different.\* \[Thus to move to postpone a resolution is
a different question from moving to postpone it after it has been
amended. A motion to suspend the rules for a certain purpose cannot be
renewed at the same meeting, but can be at an adjourned meeting. A call
for the orders of the day that has been negatived, cannot be renewed
while the question then before the assembly is still under
consideration. See Rules of Order, § 27, for many peculiarities of this
motion.\]

<span id="sec61"></span><span id="sec61a"></span>61. Order and Rules.
(a) Orders of the Day. Sometimes an assembly decides that certain
questions shall be considered at a particular time, and when that time
arrives those questions constitute what is termed the “orders of the
day,” and if any member “calls for the orders of the day,” as it
requires no second, the chairman immediately puts the question, thus:
“Will the assembly now proceed to the orders of the day?” If carried,
the subject under consideration is laid aside, and the questions
appointed for that time are taken up in their order. When the time
arrives, the chairman may state that fact, and put the above question
without waiting for a motion. If the motion fails, the call for the
orders of the day cannot be renewed till the subject then before the
assembly is disposed of.\* \[In Congress, a member entitled to the floor
cannot be interrupted by a call for the orders of the day. In an
ordinary assembly, the most common case where orders of the day are
decided upon is where it is necessary to make a programme for the
session. When the hour arrives for the consideration of any subject on
the programme, these rules permit any member to call for the orders of
the day (as described in Rules of Order, § 2) even though another person
has the floor. If this were not permitted, it would often be impossible
to carry out the programme, though wished for by the majority. A
majority could postpone the orders of the day, when called for, so as to
continue the discussion of the question then before the assembly. An
order as to the time when any subject shall be considered, must not be
confounded with the rules of the assembly; the latter must be enforced
by the chairman, without they are suspended by a two-thirds vote; the
former, in strictness, can only be carried out by the order of a
majority of the assembly then present and voting.\]

<span id="sec61b"></span>(b) Special Order. If a subject is of such
importance that it is desired to consider it at a special time in
preference to the orders of the day and established order of business,
then a motion should be made to make the question a “special order” for
that particular time. This motion requires a two-thirds vote for its
adoption, because it is really a suspension of the rules, and it is in
order whenever a motion to suspend the rules is in order. If a subject
is a special order for a particular day, then on that day it supersedes
all business except the reading of the minutes. A special order can be
postponed by a majority vote. If two special orders are made for the
same day, the one first made takes precedence.

<span id="sec61c"></span>(c) Suspension of the Rules. It is necessary
for every assembly, if discussion is allowed, to have rules to prevent
its time being wasted, and to enable it to accomplish the object for
which the assembly was organized. And yet at times their best interests
are subserved by suspending their rules temporarily. In order to do
this, some one makes a motion “to suspend the rules that interfere
with,” etc., stating the object of the suspension. If this motion is
carried by a two-thirds vote, then the particular thing for which the
rules were suspended can be done. By “general consent,” that is, if no
one objects, the rules can at any time be ignored without the formality
of a motion.

<span id="sec61d"></span>(d) Questions of Order. It is the duty of the
chairman to enforce the rules and preserve order, and when any member
notices a breach of order, he can call for the enforcement of the rules.
In such cases, when he rises he usually says, “Mr. Chairman, I rise to a
point of order.” The chairman then directs the speaker to take his seat,
and having heard the point of order, decides the question and permits
the first speaker to resume his speech, directing him to abstain from
any conduct that was decided to be out of order. When a speaker has
transgressed the rules of decorum he cannot continue his speech, if any
one objects, without permission is granted him by a vote of the
assembly. Instead of the above method, when a member uses improper
language, some one says, “I call the gentleman to order;” when the
chairman decides as before whether the language is disorderly.

<span id="sec61e"></span>(e) Appeal. While on all questions of order,
and of interpretation of the rules and of priority of business, it is
the duty of the chairman to first decide the question, it is the
privilege of any member to “appeal from the decision.” If the appeal is
seconded, the chairman states his decision, and that it has been
appealed from, and then states the question, thus: “Shall the decision
of the chair stand as the judgment of the assembly?” \[or society,
convention, etc.\]

The chairman can then, without leaving the chair, state the reasons for
his decision, after which it is open to debate (no member speaking but
once), excepting in the following cases, when it is undebatable: (1)
When it relates to transgressions of the rules of speaking, or to some
indecorum, or to the priority of business; and (2) when the previous
question was pending at the time the question of order was raised. After
the vote is taken, the chairman states that the decision of the chair is
sustained, or reversed, as the case may be.

<span id="sec62"></span><span id="sec62a"></span><span
id="sec62b"></span>62. Miscellaneous. (a) Reading of papers and (b)
Withdrawal of a motion. If a speaker wishes to read a paper, or a member
to withdraw his motion after it has been stated by the chair, it is
necessary, if any one objects, to make a motion to grant the permission.

<span id="sec62c"></span>(c) Questions of Privilege. Should any
disturbance occur during the meeting, or anything affecting the rights
of the assembly or any of the members, any member may “rise to a
question of privilege,” and state the matter, which the chairman decides
to be, or not to be, a matter of privilege: (from the chairman’s
decision of course an appeal can be taken). If the question is one of
privilege, it supersedes, for the time being, the business before the
assembly; its consideration can be postponed to another time, or the
previous question can be ordered on it so as to stop debate, or it can
be laid on the table, or referred to a committee to examine and report
upon it. As soon as the question of privilege is in some way disposed
of, the debate which was interrupted is resumed.

<span id="sec63"></span><span id="sec63a"></span>63. To Close the
Meeting. (a) Fix the time to which to adjourn. If it is desired to have
an adjourned meeting of the assembly, it is best some time before its
close to move, “That when this assembly adjourns, it adjourns to meet at
such a time,” specifying the time. This motion can be amended by
altering the time, but if made when another question is before the
assembly, neither the motion nor the amendment can be debated. If made
when no other business is before the assembly, it stands as any other
main question, and can be debated. This motion can be made even while
the assembly is voting on the motion to adjourn, but not when another
member has the floor.

<span id="sec63b"></span>(b) Adjourn. In order to prevent an assembly
from being kept in session an unreasonably long time, it is necessary to
have a rule limiting the time that the floor can be occupied by any one
member at one time.\* \[Ten minutes is allowed by these rules.\] When it
is desired to close the meeting, without the member who has the floor
will yield it, the only resource is to wait till his time expires, and
then a member who gets the floor should move “to adjourn.” The motion
being seconded, the chairman instantly put the question, as it allows of
no amendment or debate; and if decided in the affirmative, he says, “The
motion is carried;—this assembly stands adjourned.” If the assembly is
one that will have no other meeting, instead of “adjourned,” he says
“adjourned without day,” or “sine die.” If previously it had been
decided when they adjourned to adjourn to a particular time, then he
states that the assembly stands adjourned to that time. If the motion to
adjourn is qualified by specifying the time, as, “to adjourn to
to-morrow evening,” it cannot be made when any other question is before
the assembly; like any other main motion, it can then be amended and
debated.\*\* \[For the effect of an adjournment upon unfinished business
see § 69.\]

<span id="sec64"></span>64. Order of Precedence of Motions. The ordinary
motions rank as follows, and any of them (except to amend) can be made
while one of a lower order is pending, but none can supersede one of a
higher order:

To Fix the Time to which to Adjourn.  
To Adjourn (when unqualified).  
For the Orders of the Day.  
To Lie on the Table.  
For the Previous Question.  
To Postpone to a Certain Time.  
To Commit.  
To Amend.  
To Postpone Indefinitely.

The motion to Reconsider can be made when any other question is before
the assembly, but cannot be acted upon until the business then before
the assembly is disposed of; when, if called up, it takes precedence of
all other motions except to adjourn and to fix the time to which to
adjourn. Questions incidental to those before the assembly take
precedence of them, and must be acted upon first.

A question of order, a call for the orders of the day, or an objection
to the consideration of a question, can be made while another member has
the floor: so, too, can a motion to reconsider, but it can only be
entered on the minutes at that time, as it cannot supersede the question
then before the assembly.
